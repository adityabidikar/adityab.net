Some thoughts on breaking story that have coalesced for me that you may find helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Work big to small storywise: You’re building a house. Don’t start working on the fixtures until you’re sure that’s where the bathroom goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) You’ll know ideas work because they inherently spin out smaller, interesting character moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Good story creates more story. When you’re going in the right direction track starts to lay out in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">We’ve had a very productive first couple weeks in our writer’s room.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2½ cups / 500 g Greek yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⅔ cup / 150 ml olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 cloves garlic, crushed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lb / 500 g fresh or thawed frozen peas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lb / 500 g conchiglie pasta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scant ½ cup / 60 g pine nuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tsp Turkish or Syrian chile flakes (or less, depending on how spicy they are)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⅔ cups / 40 g basil leaves, coarsely torn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8 oz / 240 g feta cheese, broken into chunks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;salt and freshly ground white pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the yogurt, 6 tablespoons / 90 ml of the olive oil, the garlic, and ⅔ cup / 100 g of the peas in a food processor. Blitz to a uniform pale green sauce and transfer to a large mixing bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cook the pasta in plenty of salted boiling water until al dente. As the pasta cooks, heat the remaining olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and chile flakes and fry for 4 minutes, until the nuts are golden and the oil is deep red. Also, heat the remaining peas in some boiling water, then drain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drain the cooked pasta into a colander, shake well to get rid of the water, and add the pasta gradually to the yogurt sauce; adding it all at once may cause the yogurt to split. Add the warm peas, basil, feta, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon white pepper. Toss gently, transfer to individual bowls, and spoon over the pine nuts and their oil.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt; was written by Dave Justus (I believe he’s written or supervised every game since) and has you playing yourself, communicating with an astronaut called Taylor who’s stranded on an alien moon.

&lt;p&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;Lifeline: Whiteout&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s quite excellent. I died three more times since my last post, bringing the total up to &lt;em&gt;EIGHT&lt;/em&gt;, and I don’t in fact think I got the “happiest” ending possible, but I made it to an ending without the character dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/f8nTaC227lo&quot; alt=&quot;image title&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Next batch of Grafity’s Wall up on the lettering board for my buds &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;@therightram&lt;/a&gt; and @an_anandrk! This completes chapter 1!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations to the format, now that the novelty has worn off – mainly due to the gameplay mechanics of two choices at every decision point, which sometimes makes the player’s choice irrelevant (both choices lead to the same result) or arbitrary (the ‘go left’ or ‘go right’ decisions), but overall, 3-Minute Games have learnt over time, and the result is a game that was in many ways more enjoyable than the original &lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;, and certainly more tense at crucial moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I also liked that the horror element has been toned down in favour of a more ‘creepy sf’ vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m on to &lt;em&gt;Lifeline: Silent Night&lt;/em&gt;, which continues the adventures of Taylor from the original game. Let’s see if it ends up interesting enough to report on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">This is merely an update to my last post (and a transparent bid to get my third post for the week in under the wire).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game: Lifeline</title><link href="/blog/2017/01/14/game-lifeline/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game: Lifeline" /><published>2017-01-14T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-01-14T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/blog/2017/01/14/game-lifeline</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2017/01/14/game-lifeline/">&lt;p&gt;I played &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigfishgames.com/daily/3mingames/lifeline/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back when it was first released (in 2015, I believe) and intended to write about it back then, but forgot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game came back to me when I recommended it to a friend, and she asked me, “Which one?” – turns out 3-Minute Games have released six more games based on the same concept since I played the first one, and a seventh is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt; was written by Dave Justus (I believe he’s written or supervised every game since) and has you playing yourself, communicating with an astronaut called Taylor who’s stranded on an alien moon. You are the only person Taylor has been able to connect with, and you are Taylor’s lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You receive Taylor’s communiques in text, and you’re given two options every time Taylor needs to make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather enjoyed the game, especially the “real-time” aspect of it (for example, when Taylor goes to sleep, the game pauses for whatever duration before Taylor wakes up again), and I’d most certainly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently downloaded &lt;em&gt;Lifeline: Whiteout&lt;/em&gt; when it was Apple’s ‘Free App for the Week’ and have thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself back into this horror-tinged sf world, with the new character Adams. On the other hand, I have sucked donkey balls at playing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I played the first &lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;, I practically sailed through it, arriving at (what I later found out was) not just a happy ending, but the happiest ending available in the game (like any decent character-based game, &lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt; has multiple available endings). On the other hand, I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Whiteout&lt;/em&gt; for just two days and have killed Adams five times. &lt;em&gt;FIVE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Whiteout&lt;/em&gt;’s also managed to genuinely freak me out once or twice – I think it’s a bit more in my wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’m still playing &lt;em&gt;Whiteout&lt;/em&gt;, and will then proceed to the handy &lt;em&gt;Lifeline&lt;/em&gt; library app (in which you get &lt;em&gt;Lifeline: Silent Night&lt;/em&gt; – the third Taylor game, I think – for free as a promo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good stuff, especially at a dollar a piece.
