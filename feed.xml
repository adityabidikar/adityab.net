&lt;p&gt;“Well, you won’t know if you don’t try, will you?”—that’s the one thing I remember from the email exchange, seven years ago, that led to my first professional lettering project. Specifically, it was said to me by my publisher in response to my telling him that I lettered a bit, just for fun, but I didn’t think I could do it professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to carry that in my mind, especially since I decided I would make a career in comics while working from India, where the comics industry lies in sub-zero temperatures, a twitching near-corpse. To be clear, I have had extraordinary good luck in terms of employers and collaborators (two of whom come from similar circumstances and talk about them above this little bit), but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of the journey so far has simply been to listen to prescriptions and to doggedly ignore them—you can’t make money in comics in India, everybody wants to hire someone in their geographical vicinity, you will only ever be seen as somebody to outsource cheap work to, you gotta know people to get ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically that last one has been the most hollow, because the single biggest reason I have any work right now is that I asked strangers to look at my work and they responded with kindness they had no reason or obligation to display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to carry this into the work itself, especially with my contention that the received wisdom about comics lettering—“Good lettering is invisible”—is bullshit. I sincerely mean this, but apart from that, it’s just useful to think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your opinion about your craft will define the contours of the work you produce, and I fail to see how aspiring to be unremarkable is of any use to producing good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witness &lt;em&gt;Paradiso&lt;/em&gt;, where my collaborators and I have been attempting to put our money where our mouth is. Working around the script, I habitually add little touches like taking a panel where the reader doesn’t hear speech and reinforcing that idea by adding squiggles, implying speech, or responding to Dev’s turning a panel on its side by rotating the balloon likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continued to work on the project, Ram noticed and enjoyed these things I added, and, in issue 3, decided to build an entire section around the lettering, to the extent that he and I laid out the pages for that section and marked out panels for Dev (who, to his immense credit, responded with enthusiasm rather than with annoyance) to then draw. The lettering for these sections was then baked into the artwork and sent over to our colourist Dearbhla who added her magic. All because we looked at the rule—“Good lettering should be invisible”—and went, “Sez who?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Paradiso3_Spread.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paradiso #3&quot; title=&quot;Paradiso #3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written extensively about this elsewhere, but part of producing interesting work is feeling ownership of what you’re doing. If you trust your collaborators, you can be assured they will let you know when you’re going too wild, where you need to rein yourself in, but even if you face the occasional embarrassment of failing in public, at least there remains a chance of you producing something genuinely interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Originally written for PanelxPanel magazine.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Grafity’s Wall</title><link href="/lettering/2019/01/10/grafitys-wall/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Grafity's Wall" /><published>2019-01-10T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-01-10T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/lettering/2019/01/10/grafitys-wall</id><content type="html" xml:base="/lettering/2019/01/10/grafitys-wall/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;with Ram V, Anand Radhakrishnan, Irma Kniivila and Jason Wordie, published by Unbound Books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After figuring out a good lettering style and workflow (documented in detail &lt;a href=&quot;https://unbound.com/books/grafitys-wall/updates/writing-between-the-lines&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I lettered the whole thing on paper over printouts of Anand’s line art and matched it back to the final pages digitally.&lt;/p&gt;

I worked from Karl’s rough lettering to figure out a style with hand-drawn borderless balloons, and create sound effects that worked with the “language” he created for the sounds, most of which he letters himself. I also created an alphabet/script for the Moro language that is used from issue 3 onwards.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;These Savage Shores&lt;/em&gt;, while being set in the 18th century, is a very modern book, in its conception and execution. So for this book, I decided to put aside complete historical accuracy (in such things as the style of the letters being written by the characters, and documents produced from the age) and try to convey the feel of the era while retaining a unifying style with the artwork and colours. My focus was to maintain readability and to imply the era in a way that the reader could make their own connections. I also created the typeface used by Bishan in his letters back home in issue 3, inspired by uncial lettering and the Malayalam script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; The principal brief on this was to try out rectangular balloons. Since Ribič’s work straddles European and American styles of comic-making, I created a lettering style with elements of both—rectangular balloons with imperfect shapes combined with a more traditionally mainstream American-style body copy font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VS&lt;/em&gt; also contains graphic overlays and captions by designer Tom Muller.&lt;/p&gt;

Happy to report that as of 25th November 2018, I’ve succeeded in not smoking for more than two years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks 100 days since I quit smoking, and while the basic tenet of not smoking is “Don’t fucking smoke!”, I think there were some surprises and/or revelations that I’d like to note down in case I get complacent down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-you-dont-have-control&quot;&gt;1. You don’t have control&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ten years of being a smoker, I must have told myself hundreds of times that I could cut down to just one or two cigarettes a day, that I could quit ‘whenever I want’ or even that once I quit, I could then maybe steal a few puffs from other people’s cigarettes and not really smoke again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, none of that worked. I’d always fall back into the habit. However much I love smoking (and that’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;), the Golden Rule is the Golden Rule for a reason:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not another puff. No matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a screenshot of this on my phone that I used to look at for the first month or so whenever my brain tried to convince me that maybe I could have one puff without worrying about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to look at it anymore, but I still repeat it to myself whenever I see a cigarette and think, “That looks nice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-once-an-addict-always-an-addict&quot;&gt;2. Once an addict, always an addict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a corollary to the first one. My addict’s mantra is that since I don’t know where to stop, the only solution is not to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cravings have now mostly gone away, and my brain chemistry does not factor nicotine into everything it does, I have to be aware of the fact that I’m &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; five minutes away from my next cigarette. Each and every cigarette I’m confronted with is tempting to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were times in the past when I fooled myself into thinking that I was &lt;em&gt;no longer&lt;/em&gt; an addict, but that is and will probably always be bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-quitting-is-not-a-golden-ticket-to-health&quot;&gt;3. Quitting is not a golden ticket to health&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one’s fairly obvious to people who don’t smoke, but when I was smoking, I convinced myself that if only I could quit smoking, I’d start doing all the healthy things and, I dunno, run or something like that. That did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there was this constriction I used to feel in my chest when I woke up in the morning that I’d always assumed was because of my smoking. Turns out I’d just been sleeping wrong for fucking &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-not-being-a-smoker-is-nice&quot;&gt;4. Not being a smoker is nice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have not miraculously turned into a model of health since I quit smoking, it is, generally, &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; to not be a smoker. I can taste better, there isn’t the physical drag of diminished lung capacity, and my mind isn’t constantly wandering to when I’ll next get a chance to smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing about being a smoker, for me, was being under the invisible hold of something that literally turned my brain against me - a passenger that would &lt;em&gt;make me want to&lt;/em&gt; do something to myself that was so bad for me. It’s nice not to feel like that every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-the-feelings-all-the-feelings&quot;&gt;5. The feelings, all the feelings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, I knew that smoking numbs your reactions to things that happen to you. Since I quit, I’ve just &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; more. (And not just as a consequence of withdrawal - this is afterwards.) This is not, to be sure, a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing. It’s mostly like the return of taste - there are a lot more flavours to emotions that I can now experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was difficult for a while, but you get used to it, your brain gets more able to manage it, and then it starts feeling normal. You should know - I’m sure most people reading this aren’t gibbering wrecks just because they don’t smoke. It’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5b-coffee&quot;&gt;5b. Coffee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a full point by itself, but I’ve become a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more sensitive to the physical effects of coffee since I stopped smoking, and that sucks, because now I can only drink it a couple of times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; coffee, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Reposted from the old blog, written on 8th January 2017.
