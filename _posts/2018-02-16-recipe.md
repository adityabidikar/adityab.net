**Ingredients:**
- 2½ cups / 500 g Greek yogurt
- ⅔ cup / 150 ml olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 lb / 500 g fresh or thawed frozen peas
- 1 lb / 500 g conchiglie pasta
- scant ½ cup / 60 g pine nuts
- 2 tsp Turkish or Syrian chile flakes (or less, depending on how spicy they are)
- 1⅔ cups / 40 g basil leaves, coarsely torn
- 8 oz / 240 g feta cheese, broken into chunks
- salt and freshly ground white pepper

**Preparation:**
1. Put the yogurt, 6 tablespoons / 90 ml of the olive oil, the garlic, and ⅔ cup / 100 g of the peas in a food processor. Blitz to a uniform pale green sauce and transfer to a large mixing bowl.
2. Cook the pasta in plenty of salted boiling water until al dente. As the pasta cooks, heat the remaining olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and chile flakes and fry for 4 minutes, until the nuts are golden and the oil is deep red. Also, heat the remaining peas in some boiling water, then drain.
3. Drain the cooked pasta into a colander, shake well to get rid of the water, and add the pasta gradually to the yogurt sauce; adding it all at once may cause the yogurt to split. Add the warm peas, basil, feta, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon white pepper. Toss gently, transfer to individual bowls, and spoon over the pine nuts and their oil.
