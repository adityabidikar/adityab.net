_with Ram V, Anand Radhakrishnan, Irma Kniivila and Jason Wordie, published by Unbound Books._

**Notes:** As Ram is fond of reminding me, hand-lettering _Grafity’s Wall_ was a decision I made in a pub while out drinking with him and Anand, and it ended up a tremendous learning experience. After figuring out a good lettering style and workflow (documented in detail [here](https://unbound.com/books/grafitys-wall/updates/writing-between-the-lines)), I lettered the whole thing on paper over printouts of Anand’s line art and matched it back to the final pages digitally.
