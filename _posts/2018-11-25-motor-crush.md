_with Cameron Stewart, Brenden Fletcher, Babs Tarr, Heather Danforth, Tom Muller and Jennifer Smith, published by Image Comics._

Notes: For _Motor Crush_, Babs wanted manga-inspired balloons and a bouncy, natural rhythm to the placements. In addition, Babs did most of the sound effects, so any additional effects I did needed to match hers. I also chose to digitally hand-draw all the balloons in the book, and break open balloons to the gutters where necessary.

_Motor Crush_ also contains graphic overlays and captions by designer Tom Muller.

Additionally, _Motor Crush_ #6 was an all-flashback issue drawn by Cameron, so for that one, I used a mix of more traditional American comics lettering and the style we'd already established.
