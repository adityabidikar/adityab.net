We've had a very productive first couple weeks in our writer's room. Some thoughts on breaking story that have coalesced for me that you may find helpful:

1) Work big to small storywise: You're building a house. Don't start working on the fixtures until you're sure that's where the bathroom goes.

2) You'll know ideas work because they inherently spin out smaller, interesting character moments.

3) Good story creates more story. When you're going in the right direction track starts to lay out in front of you.
