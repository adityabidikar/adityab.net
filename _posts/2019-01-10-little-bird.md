**Notes:** _Little Bird_ uses my custom font ‘Mighty Mouse’ for the body copy, along with a rough, energetic ballooning style that lets me insert hand-drawn lettering alongside the fonts, so I can move from more consistent lettering for the quieter scenes to more varied balloons and sound effects for the dynamic action scenes.
