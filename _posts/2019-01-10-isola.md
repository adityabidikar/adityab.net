_with Brenden Fletcher, Karl Kerschl and MSassyK, published by Image Comics._

**Notes:** I was asked to letter _Isola_ after working with Brenden on _Motor Crush_. I worked from Karl’s rough lettering to figure out a style with hand-drawn borderless balloons, and create sound effects that worked with the “language” he created for the sounds, most of which he letters himself. I also created an alphabet/script for the Moro language that is used from issue 3 onwards. I was interviewed about the process of lettering _Isola_ [here](https://www.comics-now.com/home/2018/4/2/lettering-a-legend-aditya-bidikar-on-the-highly-collaborative-isola).
