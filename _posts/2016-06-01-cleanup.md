The last iteration of this blog was supposed to simplify the format to the point where I might end up using it more than a couple of times a month, but it came to light that it was in fact more complex to maintain than a standard-format blog.

Also, I tried to integrate a year and a half’s worth of existing posts into the new format, which made things even more unwieldy.

This is an attempt at a refresh, a good scrub of the dishes so that I can make things simple again. Still no categories or tags (although I’ll have these on the backend) and definitely no comments. I will be adding post titles back, though.

If this doesn’t work, I might _finally_ give in to Tumblr.
