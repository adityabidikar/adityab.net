The first _Lifeline_ was written by Dave Justus (I believe he’s written or supervised every game since) and has you playing yourself, communicating with an astronaut called Taylor who’s stranded on an alien moon. You are the only person Taylor has been able to connect with, and you are Taylor’s lifeline.
