This is merely an update to my last post (and a transparent bid to get my third post for the week in under the wire).

I finally finished _Lifeline: Whiteout_, and it’s quite excellent. I died three more times since my last post, bringing the total up to _EIGHT_, and I don’t in fact think I got the “happiest” ending possible, but I made it to an ending without the character dying.

There are a few limitations to the format, now that the novelty has worn off – mainly due to the gameplay mechanics of two choices at every decision point, which sometimes makes the player’s choice irrelevant (both choices lead to the same result) or arbitrary (the ‘go left’ or ‘go right’ decisions), but overall, 3-Minute Games have learnt over time, and the result is a game that was in many ways more enjoyable than the original _Lifeline_, and certainly more tense at crucial moments. 

>I also liked that the horror element has been toned down in favour of a more ‘creepy sf’ vibe.

Now I’m on to _Lifeline: Silent Night_, which continues the adventures of Taylor from the original game. Let’s see if it ends up interesting enough to report on.
