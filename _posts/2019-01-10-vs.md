_with Iván Brandon, Esad Ribič, Nic Klein, Tom Muller and Sebastian Girner, published by Image Comics._

**Notes:** The principal brief on this was to try out rectangular balloons. Since Ribič’s work straddles European and American styles of comic-making, I created a lettering style with elements of both—rectangular balloons with imperfect shapes combined with a more traditionally mainstream American-style body copy font.

_VS_ also contains graphic overlays and captions by designer Tom Muller.
