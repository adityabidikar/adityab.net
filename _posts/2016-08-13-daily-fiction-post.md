Also, I tried to integrate a year and a half’s worth of existing posts into the new format, which made things even more unwieldy.

This is an attempt at a refresh, a good scrub of the dishes so that I can make things simple again. Still no categories or tags (although I’ll have these on the backend) and definitely no comments. I will be adding post titles back, though.

If this doesn’t work, I might _finally_ give in to Tumblr.
