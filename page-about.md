I’m Aditya Bidikar, and I work as a comic-book letterer (current projects include Drifter, Grant Morrison’s 18 Days, Avatarex – you can visit my portfolio [here]()).

This is my blog about things I’m interested in – lettering, comics, books, movies … stuff like that. The aim of this blog is principally to keep me writing semi-regularly, so I doubt anything terribly exciting will happen here anytime soon.

I also used to write a blog called Daily Fiction, on which I posted 229 short stories, after which it ground to an ignominious halt. These stories are available [here]().

If you’d like to talk to me, I’m on Twitter at [@adityab](https://twitter.com/adityab). I sometimes post pictures of work-in-progress and cats I meet on my Instagram. And to comment on the blog, or to talk to me about work, you can always email me at [aditya@adityab.net](mailto:aditya@adityab.net).
