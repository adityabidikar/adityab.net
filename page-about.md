I’m Aditya Bidikar, and I work as a comic-book letterer (current projects include _Isola_, _These Savage Shores_, _Motor Crush_ and _Bloodborne_—you can visit my portfolio [here](/lettering)).

I also create fonts that will soon be available for purchase—stay tuned to the 'Fonts' section on the left.

I also occasionally write comics and prose, which you can access in the 'Writing' section on the left—again, still under construction.

If you’d like to talk to me, I’m on Twitter at [@adityab](https://twitter.com/adityab). I sometimes post pictures of work-in-progress and cats I meet on [my Instagram](http://instagram.com/adityabidikar). And to comment on the blog, or to talk to me about work, you can always email me at [aditya@adityab.net](mailto:aditya@adityab.net).
